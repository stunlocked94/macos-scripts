# macos-scripts

This is a repository where i collect Scripts i use in macOS. Locally i use [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/) to collect and organize scripts.

## Authors notes:
- [moveappstobrew.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stunlocked94/macos-scripts/refs/heads/main/moveappstobrew.sh) is not my script. I copied it from somewhere on the internet because the original autor deleted it.
